<h3> Punk'd </h3>

<p>
  The form you just used was not rendered by anything official PUBG. In fact,
  it was served from <span id="apiUrl">[PLACEHOLDER]</span>. If this were
  more than just a proof-of-concept, your username/password would be sent back
  to that server and thus end up in unauthorized hands.
</p>

<p>
  This is a serious problem. Please pressure the PUBG team to fix it ASAP.

  <em>Developer?</em> Why not see what you can make happen in this page using
